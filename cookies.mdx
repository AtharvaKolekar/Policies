Welcome to **athrva.in**! This Cookies Policy explains how we use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience and keep your account secure.

By using this site, you agree to our use of cookies as described below.

## 🔍 What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files that websites store on your device to recognize you, save preferences, or understand usage patterns.

We use both **first-party cookies** (set by us) and **third-party cookies** (from services like Google Analytics and Corbado).

---

## ⚙️ Why We Use Cookies

We use cookies for two main purposes:

### 1. **Essential Cookies (Authentication & Security)**

These are necessary for the website to function and include:

- Login session management via **Corbado**
- User identification for secure access
- Session state handling

> Without these cookies, you won’t be able to securely log in or use core features.

### 2. **Analytics Cookies (Performance & Insights)**

We use **Google Analytics** to gather anonymous usage data like:

- Pages visited
- Time spent on site
- Device/browser type

This helps us improve performance and UX.
